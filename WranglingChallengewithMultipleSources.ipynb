    "* `Warnings` to hide any Jupyter Notebook kernel warning messages.\n",
    "* `Pandas` for manipulating the data extracted from the different sources.\n",
    "* `Numpy` to perform a number of array based operations on the data.\n",
    "* `BeautifulSoup` to parse the XML file properly.\n",
    "* `XML.SAX` to check whether the XML file has syntactical issues.\n",
    "* `Glob` to return the file path of the XML file\n",
    "* `SYS` to capture the runtime XML parsing error\n",
    "* `Math` to calculate the haversine distance between the property and the closest station.\n",
    "* `Re` to capture incorrect time formats in the metropolitan stop time data.\n",
    "* `Selenium` to web scrape the required data from https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au.\n",
    "* `Camelot` to scan the PDF file and import the tabular data.\n",
    "* `Shapely` to help match a property point to a suburb polygon \n",
    "* `Geopandas` to manipulate the data extracted from a shapefile.\n",
    "* `Sklearn` to perform different scaling and transformation methods on the web scraped data.\n",
    "* `Statsmodels` to use the Least Squares method for assessing linearity and outliers.\n",
    "* `Seaborn` for visualisation of the results of different scaling and transformation methods.\n",

This will be a left join as we want all the property point coordinates, irrespective of whether there is a suburb polygon they can fit into. For the proprties which don't have a suburb in the shapefile data, the right table columns will be NULL. We must also specify the `vic_loca_2` column here as that is the one we are interested in from the shapefile data.\n",

    "We must populate these columns by performing a web scraping operation to retrieve them from the website https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/. The data in these columns is related to the suburb of a property in our integrated dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.6.1 Scraping the Links\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we need to web scrape all the links which contain data we want to populate each and every one of the above columns. There are two popular libraries which facilitate web scraping or crawling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* BeautifulSoup\n",
    "* Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use Selenium to web scrape through the data as it is less messier to code than BeautifulSoup for a beginner. What also makes selenium great for webscraping is its ability to handle dynamic Javascript elements in a website while performing its crawl. A drawback of Selenium is that it relies on the Chrome webdriver to be actively running. Complex web scrapping operations can also be performed with a combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup. But that won't be the case here as this is a simple scraping operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please install Selenium via conda or pip before running and marking the below code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: Web Scraping with Selenium requires the Google Chrome webdriver to be running while pushing and pulling the scraping requests. For checking and executing the below code, please have the Chrome webdriver in the same directory as this `.pynb` notebook and run it using the below code. If a break in your internet connection stops the webdriver, kindly re-run it using the code in the next code block.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**INSTALLING CHROMEDRIVER: To install the Chrome webdriver, please download it from this link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/\n",
    "Please check your version of Google Chrome before downloading the right version of Chromedriver. A version mismatch will cause the driver to not run properly. You can check and update your version of Google Chrome by navigating to Settings -> About Chrome. Recommended Version: 102.0.5005.61**"

To get the exact tag where the required data is available, we can visit the website and inspect its web content. For each suburb, we need the data for `House Report`, `Median House Price`, `House quarterly growth`, `House 12 month growth` and `House average annual growth`.\n",
    "* Add a try and except block to the looping process to ensure that if the data to be extracted does not exist for a particular suburb, the value `Not available` or `N/A` is returned depending on the requirements given in the sample output. An `N/A` value will be returned when the element being searched for does not exist for a particular suburb. A special case of an exception handler called `NoSuchElementException` will help to handle the exception that a particular element does not exist for the data we are trying to extract. This exception is available as a part of the Selenium library. \n",
    "* Clean the string elements in the list if required.\n",
    "* Update the dictionaries with the appended list of values.\n",
    "* For each dictionary, match the dictionary keys to the rows in the suburbs column of the main dataframe. Create a new column and populate it with the respective dictionary items based on the key-column match."

    "Just by visually looking at the comparison of the scales, it is clear that overall, the standardization has scaled the data better than the minmax method. The bigger question is whether either or both of these scaling methods have improved the linearity between the three features and `House_quarterly_growth`. As was the case before, let us check the linearity with the help of the R-squared value and the correlation matrix."

Changing them to positive values would discard the their meaning as it pertains to the suburban data.\n",

First let us observe what happens to the distribution of the data on applying the root transformation. We can use the `.sqrt()` function from the numpy library to do this."

    "### 4.7 Summarising the Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "We did a lot of tweaking and adjusting in the data reshaping process. Here are the final conclusions we can draw from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The original data presented a relatively low linearity between `House_quarterly_growth` and the input feature. This was highlighted through the correlation matrix and an R-squared value of 0.00821.<br><br>\n",
    "* We applied two different scaling techniques on the data and compared the result. The standardization scaler scaled the values in the range [-1, 1] and the min-max scaler scaled the values in the range [0,1].<br><br>\n",
    "* The Standardized scalar scaled the input features better than the MinMax Scaler.<br><br>\n",
    "* Both scaling techniques scaled the data well overall but they did not improve the linearity between the target variable and the input attributes.<br><br>\n",
    "* Transformations to be applied on the scaled data were:\n",
    "     * Root Transformation\n",
    "     * Log Transformation\n",
    "     * Power Transformation <br><br>\n",
    "* The Box-cox transformation could not be applied here as it operates on positive values only.<br><br>\n",
    "* The Root transformation was only applied to the minmaxed data as it cannot accept negative values.<br><br>\n",
    "* For the minmaxed values, the root transformation reduced the left skewness in `Median_house_price`. On the flipside, it increased the skewness in `House_twelve_month_growth` and `House_average_annual_growth`. It had the same effect on the correlation of these three variables with `House_quarterly_growth`.<br><br>\n",
    "* Given this observation, we tried to generate the R-squared value with the transformed values of `Median_house_price` while using the existing minmaxed values of the other two columns. We got an R-squared value of around 0.00861, which is a significant improvement from the previous value of 0.00821.<br><br>\n",
    "* We tried applying the `log transformation` on the `minmaxed data` only as the logarithm of negative values is undefined.<br><br>\n",
    "* The `log transformation` of the minmaxed values resulted in infinite values. Therefore, we had to dismiss the log transformation method.<br><br>\n",
    "* With the `power transformation`, the benefit was that we could apply this to the standardized values as well as the minmaxed values.<br><br>\n",
    "* We observed that the power transformation made the standardized values more left skewed, even though it improved the correlation coefficient of `House_twelve_month_growth` with `House_quarterly_growth`. Furthermore, the R-squared value of the fully transformed model was the best on yet at 0.022. Despite this, it was an unacceptable outcome.<br><br>\n",
    "* Now, combining the transformed `House_twelve_month_growth` with the existing standardized columns into a model gave us a lower R-squared value of 0.015 but in comparison with the model of the fully power transformed data, this is preferred. <br><br>\n",
    "* Despite these findings and an improved R-squared value from the root transformation, the skewness of this transformation makes it undesirable in the end.<br><br>\n",
    "* Applying the power transformation on the minmaxed data created a left skew in the distribution for `Median_house_price` and `House_average_annual_growth` but it improved the normality of `House_twelve_month_growth`. The improvement in correlation between `House_quarterly_growth` and the power transformed minmaxed `House_twelve_month_growth` was the same as that of the power transformed standardized values. Similarly, the R-squared value was the same as well standing at 0.015.\n",

    "In conclusion, there are two contenders for the most optimum linearity between the input features and `House_quarterly_growth`:\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a lot of potential to improve the linear relationship. There are a number of other techniques which could also be applied to the data to improve the linearity of the target variable `House_quarterly_growth` with respect to the features `Median_house_growth`, `House_twelve_month_growth` and `House_average_annual_growth`.\n",

For example, outlier removal can be applied on the power transformed minmax data. Other techniques like k-folds cross validation can be used to determine the importance of the input features with respect to the target variable."
