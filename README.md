# WranglingChallengeRealEstateDataCompilation
In this project, I wrangled suburban real estate housing data for Victoria, Australia from multiple sources and file formats, brought it into a single consistent schema and analysed the `house quarterly growth`, `median house price`, `house twelve-month growth` and more.
The GeoJson Data and the Victoria Metropolitan Data can be found at this location: [Metropolitan-Location Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LW_jwFj5yh132oYopo3shmAoVGfMwLgf?usp=sharing)
The real estate housing prices for Victoria were web-scrapped from: [Your Investment Property](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/).
